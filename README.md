# Welcome to Alexandre's GitHub Profile

## About Me

Hello! I'm Alexandre, and I'm on a journey to exploire the world of IT. I have a passion for web developpement even though it's new for me and that I have other projects at the same time.

In my free time, you'll often find me either attempting to fix the sink or indulging in ways to escape from reality, but that's a tale for another time.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons. Whether it's building a groundbreaking app, or becoming a recognized expert in my field, I'm driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-daumail) to join me on this exciting journey of exploration and discovery!
