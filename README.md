## About Me

Hello! I'm Alexandre, and I'm on a journey to exploire the world of IT. I have a passion for web developpement.

In my free time, you'll often find me either attempting to fix the sink or indulging in ways to escape from reality, but that's a tale for another time.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons. Whether it's building a groundbreaking app, or becoming a recognized expert in my field, I'm driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-daumail) to join me on this exciting journey of exploration and discovery!

I also have a [portfolio](https://www.alexandre-daumail.fr/) if you want to see some of my live projects (work in progress).

## My Projects

I'm actually working on refactoring my previous projects in order to be up to date with the skills that I have gained in my previous job. I worked for a year in Digimood, a digital marketing agency, as a web developper.
We used to design and develop apps for the SEO and SEA Consultants. My focus today is to show my proficiency in React and Typescript because my old projects are outdated and very basic.

## Contributions

I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects. If you have an interesting project or idea, feel free to reach out to me, and I'd be happy to contribute.
